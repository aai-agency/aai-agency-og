# Welcome to aai ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to aai!ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™re an agency focused on automating Oil & Gas workflows from manual Excel processes to building full AI Workflows & Agents.

This repo includes real workflows weâ€™ve built and used. Weâ€™re sharing them here in case theyâ€™re helpful to others in the industry.

Everything is open source so feel free to clone, modify, or use the code however youâ€™d like.

We also run a newsletter that breaks down tangible tech examples in Oil & Gas. You can try out any of the featured applications directly through our interactive demos at https://aai.agency/newsletter.
